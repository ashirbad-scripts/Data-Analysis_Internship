## How to run the codes and see outputs

1. **Run the program** in any standard Python environment.  
2. The output will be generated and stored in **`Data Analysis_Internship/Outputs`**.  
3. Inside the **Outputs** folder, each task’s results are saved in the appropriate sub‑directories.

## What happened in this project?

### What’s done !!

A restaurant dataset was provided; the task was to analyze the data and present the required insights visually. Python and its libraries were used for the analysis and plotting.

### 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- folium (for geographic mapping)  
- numpy (minor scaling operations)  
- Jupyter & VS Code (as IDEs)

## ⚠️ Notes

- All scripts are **independent** and modular.  
- Plots are stored under `/Outputs/` and `/Outputs/Level_3_Output/`.
